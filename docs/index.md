#Overview

##Introducing Comdex

Comdex is a decentralized synthetics protocol of the Cosmos ecosystem. Users of Comdex can create and trade a wide range of commodity synthetic assets. Comdex builds solutions to democratize finance by giving investors exposure to an extensive range of asset classes.


##What are synthetic assets?

A synthetic asset is an on-chain derivative that derives its value based on the price of an underlying asset. Synthetics enable investors to take exposure to just the price movements of assets without taking any ownership of the underlying asset. On Comdex, users can create, trade, and provide liquidity of a range of synthetic commodity assets.


##Why synthetics?

Due to geographical limitations, investors today lack the freedom to access a large set of financial assets. Synthetics allow for the tokenization of real-world assets with fewer hurdles than those in the traditional derivative markets. Synthetics also enable asset originators to gain liquidity on their illiquid debt assets by creating synthetics that facilitate a seamless flow of capital between asset classes. 


##Why Commodities?

Commodities trade, a $17 trillion industry, is unquestionably the lifeblood of global supply chains. In times of economic uncertainty and high inflation, commodities prices tend to have long term inflation-resistance due to their inherently tangible and pragmatic value. 

Investors today cannot freely access these assets due to several hurdles. Additionally, SME & MSME borrowers lack the trust and efficiency needed to qualify for financing, causing a $3.4 trillion financing gap. 

By combining the immutability of blockchain and interoperability of IBC, Comdex's synthetics protocol enables investors to take exposure to a broad range of financial assets seamlessly. By creating solutions across the industry, Comdex aims to build bridges for the flow of capital from DeFi and CeFi.

##What solutions does Comdex build?

Comdex is building a decentralized synthetics protocol on the Cosmos SDK to allow Cosmos ecosystem investors to trade commodity synthetics. Comdex has built an enterprise trading platform for physical commodities trading, built on the Persistence SDK, that enhances trust and efficiency in the commodities trade and trade finance industries.
Comdex will launch ShipFi, a dApp for digitization and exchange of commodity trade finance debt.
