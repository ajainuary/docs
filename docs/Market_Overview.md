# Market Overview


A Market acts as a bridge between Real World Data and Blockchains. It sets data from the outside world (oracles), such as the cost of the commodities in our protocol, mapped to an asset. So based on this data, Market feeds the protocol with information that can trigger predefined actions to our Market. Price quotes are kept updated by market feeders and are in sync periodically fetching exchange rates from reputable sources and reporting them to the protocol.
