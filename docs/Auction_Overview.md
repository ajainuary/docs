# Overview

When the Collateralization Ratio falls below the Liquidation Ratio in a particular vault, to bring the Collateralization Ratio above the Liquidation Ratio, the liquidated vaults will be moved to the auction page for bidding in terms of cAsset at a 5% discount.  
On the auction page, users can place their bids using cAssets. The bid placed should be higher than the opening/previous bid. The bidding lasts for 6hr, and the highest bid takes it all. The auctioned assets are then transferred to the bidderâ€™s account.
