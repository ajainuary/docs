#Overview

In order to enhance the ‘pool lock-in’ period and increase the amount of liquidity available at any point of time for swapping cAssets, we need to reduce the probability of the liquidity provider immediately dumping the native token in the open market in order to claim their rewards without contributing to the stability of the pool. If the user provides liquidity in the form of cXAU to the cXAU-UST pool in the ratio of 50:50, the user receives CMDX rewards. 
To begin with, Comdex will allocate a total of 5,000,000 tokens for each quarter, specifically for liquidity providers, yielding approximately 55,555.55 tokens available to distribute to liquidity providers per day. With Liquidity Providers assigned as LPi (i being 1 to nth Liquidity provider) and their shares of tokens being assigned LPi tokens; their share in each liquidity pool being denoted P pool name i, we can calculate the number of CMDX tokens being allocated to each LP as follows:
